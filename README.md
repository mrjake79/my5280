League management for 5280 Pool League.

This plugin for WordPress requires the LeagueManager and Connections plugins to be installed and active.  It has 
been published to GitHub for the purpose of sharing with potential employers and is not intended for use by any
other parties for any other reason.

This is the author's first WordPress plugin and is certainly not representative of coding style or ability.  Its
indended use is solely for a recreational pool league website, with the primary purpose being the removal of
some rather complex Excel files from the process of recording match outcomes and standings.
